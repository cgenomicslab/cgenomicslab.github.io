description: "Robbie graduated from the University of Miami with a degree in Neuroscience. He studied how transcription factors regulate axon regeneration in the central nervous system as an undergraduate in [Dr. Vance Lemmon's](https://www.lembixlab.net) lab.


In the Fraser lab, Robbie is interested in utilizing biochemical and structural techniques to study interactions between chitin-binding proteins and chitin.


When he's not in lab, Robbie is promoting DEI efforts, reading books (more often tweets), or enjoying a San Francisco park.


Robbie is supported by graduate fellowships from [NSF](http://www.nsfgrfp.org/) and [HHMI](http://www.hhmi.org/science-education/programs/gilliam-fellowships-advanced-study/), and his cats [Boo the Cat](/pets/#Boo%20the%20Cat) and [Timo the Cat](/pets/#Timo%20the%20Cat)."
