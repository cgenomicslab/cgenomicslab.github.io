description: "Flip hails from the Netherlands, where he obtained Master's degrees in Nanobiology from TU Delft and the Erasmus Medical Center, and in Econometrics from Erasmus University Rotterdam. His Nanobiology undergraduate thesis focused on structural and functional assays of membrane proteins, and for his Master's, he developed a cryo-EM processing pipeline for studying gas vesicles. In the Fraser lab, Flip will further his interest in structural biology by focusing on projects that involve electron microscopy processing and protein structure modeling. Outside of the lab, Flip enjoys running, exploring the city or nature, and watching movies."
