description: "Priyanka did her Bachelor's in Biochemistry at Sri Venkateswara College, University of Delhi and her Master's in Biochemistry at the University of Hyderabad. She completed her Ph.D. from Molecular Biophysics Unit, Indian Institute of Science under Prof. Raghavan Vardarajan. Her Ph.D. work involved developing high-thoughput screens for measuring the mutational sensitivity of the toxin component of the toxin-antitoxin system of *E. coli*. She carried out deep mutational scans of the site-saturation mutagenesis library and single-site synonymous mutant library of the toxin gene in operonic context. 


In the Fraser lab, Priyanka will perform deep mutational scanning on cancer-related proteins.


Outside the lab, Priyanka likes to dance, go on adventurous trips and explore the city."
