description: "Ann recently earned a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Biochemistry from San Jose State University, where her research in [Dr. Emma Carroll's lab](https://www.ecarrolllab.com/) focused on the biophysical effects of ubiquitination on amyloid-forming proteins. In the Fraser lab, she will be working on all things macrodomain. Outside of the lab, Ann enjoys exploring new culinary experiences and can often be found lining up at the latest restaurants around the city."
