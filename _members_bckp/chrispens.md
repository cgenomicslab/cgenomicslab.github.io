description: "Karson graduated from Walla Walla University with a degree in Bioengineering. During his undergraduate training, he worked on methods for high-throughput determination of antibody binding affinities under the mentorship of [Dr. Timothy Whitehead](https://www.colorado.edu/faculty/whitehead/) at CU Boulder. 

Now, in the Fraser Lab, Karson aims to study protein conformational ensembles using the rich experimental data in structural biology in combination with generative modeling.

Outside of lab, Karson enjoys biking, running, skiing, listening to jazz, and board games. He also drinks lots of tea and coffee."
