My main scientific interest is the emergence of novel cellular functions via gene duplication. Duplication is the substrate for functional change or specialization. Currently I am working on the evolution of synaptic machinery in animals. Here gene duplication seems to be the primary driver of functional novelty. I have found that various components of synapses were present before neuronal emergence. I am combining phylogenomic analysis and cell biology methods to try and understand how synaptic functions such as neurotransmitter transport and synthesis evolved even before the split of animals and fungi. 



I am also interested in membrane transporter evolution, structure and function.
